# TODO LIST

This will just be a space to record what needs to be done in documentation

1. Write admin topics
   1. Write programming lead and apprentice responsibilities
2. Write curriculum topics
   1. Understanding ROS2 Control
   2. Understanding tf2
   3. Understanding URDF files
   4. Understanding Docker
   5. Understanding PlatformIO?
   6. Understanding Nav2
   7. Understanding Gazebo
   8. Learn embedded programming (for the microcontrollers)
   9. Important embedded concepts
3. Write non programmer friendly topics
   1. Find resources to learn basic programming (both reading and video)
   2. Write a simplified ROS2 lesson including an exercise
   3. Conceptual overviews (include diagrams)
      1. Full communication loop from groundstation to motors
      2. Full logic pipeline
      3. Typical programming cycle???
   4. How to convert from STL to URDF
   5. Glossary with basic programming terms
4. Write technical documentation topics
   1. Maybe include a crash course in electrical engineering? At the very least how to work with electrical
   2. Downloading ROS2 (probably just going to use Docker but include options to install it locally as well)
   3. Setup PlatformIO
   4. Setup Docker
   5. How to write a xacro file
   6. How to write a launch file
      1. Sim launch
      2. Real launch
   7. How to write ROS2 Control stuff
      1. Controller yaml
      2. Hardware interface
      3. Etc
   8. How vision pipelines work
   9. How to setup a brand new Jetson Orin Nano (both fresh out of the box and reflashing an existing one)
5. Write systems engineering stuff
   1. More general AND very technical descriptions and diagrams
   2. Why are we using the software we picked? What was our decision process?
   3. Current architecture
   4. Things to improve next year
